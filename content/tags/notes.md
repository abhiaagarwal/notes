Notes about various topics. I wouldn't consider these comprehensive or pointing in any one direction or opinions, just a dump of bullet points and citations.

These are continually in a work-in-progress state. The world is constantly changing, and I am constantly learning. I will update them as needed. Please feel free to view the "History" button on the right sidebar to watch the evolution of these notes, which are stored in git.
