# Abusing long context

(4/12/25) I've been investigating fine-grained authorization recently, and landed on using [[openfga]]. While it's cool, it's also sparsely documented. I used [gitingest.com](http://gitingest.com) to get the entire source code of the python sdk into one file, then dumped it into [[gemini-2.5-pro]] and asked it to write me FastAPI middleware. It designed something that had _good_ taste. It was a really beautiful abstraction, and took 80 seconds to create.
