Notes about programming! I'm not really sure the best-way to organize this, as programming involves a lot of moving parts, of which includes the language of choice, how the language interfaces with the operating system, etc.

So, this is organized as "best-effort", basically. I try to jot down interesting things as I find them. Use the search bar for anything specific!
