title: Welcome to my notes :)

I tend to spend hours, sometime even days, at a time going on wild goose chases to answer the weird questions I have.

I'd like to think of it as kinda a hobby. My father would always tell me not to learn too much "useless information". While I understand his perspective, to me, one of the few joys of life is collecting little trinkets of information. At the very least, they make for great conversation.

I intend this to be a public repository of all the things I've read or discovered in my short time on this world. Enjoy :)
