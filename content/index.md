I tend to spend hours, sometime even days, at a time going on wild goose chases to answer the weird questions I have.

I'd like to think of it as kinda a hobby. My father would always tell me not to learn too much "useless information". While I understand his perspective, to me, one of the few joys of life is collecting little trinkets of information. At the very least, they make for great conversation.

So, this is a collection of various writings about, uh, thingies! This is intended mostly to be short-form content, things I could write as they pop into my head while waiting for the T. I make no promises for what this site may contain, both in quality and substance. That is to say, please do not cite me seriously.

Please feel free to click around and find whatever tickles your fancy. Enjoy :)
