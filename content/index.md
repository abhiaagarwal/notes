description: Welcome to Abhi's Notes, a place for short-form thoughts about thingies.

I tend to spend hours, sometime even days, going on wild goose chases to answer the weird questions I have.

I'd like to think of it as a hobby. My father would always tell me not to learn too much "useless information". While I understand his perspective, to me, one of the few joys of life is collecting little trinkets of information.

So, this is a collection of various writings about thingies! This is intended mostly to be short-form content, things I write as they pop into my head while waiting for the T. It could be reference material based on a question I had, it could be my thoughts about a show I recently watched. I make no promises for what this site may contain, both in quality and substance. My goal is for everything to be readable in under 10 minutes. That is to say, please do not cite me seriously.

If you're interested in what I have to say in more of a long-form format, check out my [blog](https://abhi.rodeo/blog). That's intended to be a bit more published content, more on the technical side. 

Please feel free to click around and find whatever tickles your fancy. There's also a search bar. To help guide you, here's a list of tags I use to try and organize anything I create.

[[tags/notes]]
[[tags/thoughts]]
[[tags/observations]]

Enjoy :)
