I really don't like c++. It was the first language I ever learned, at the ripe age of 13. I nearly gave up programming because of it. cpp reminds me a lot of english. Powerful, expressive, but none of it makes sense and there are so many footguns that I'm glad I have a few toes remaining.

This is a running list of all the times cpp's stupid behavior has burnt me.
