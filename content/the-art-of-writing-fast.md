I really want to become a better writer. My whole life, I've been paralyzed by my own poor prose, jealous of people who can communicate, and desperate to be one of them. I started this mini-blog as a way to develop those writing skills.

Yet I don't write much. Well, I do. I write something, then I leave it in a half-finished state, then I scrap it. I get halfway through an idea, then discover something new about it, then leave it trapped in the prison of my mind, only to be forgotten and rediscovered a few months later.

I saw this tweet the other day.

I don't really read the news or newsletters, but I _do_ happily subscribe to CHH. And they're right! She writes a lot. She articulates well. And she writes _fast_ (certainly fast enough that I feel I'm getting good value out of my subscription).

My new years resolution is to write a lot, and to write _fast_. I would say once a day but that seems optimistic, but maybe I say once a week? It's probably going to be pretty shitty. I'm the type of person who has a paralyzing fear of doing anything and not being immediately in the 90th percentile. I'll hold myself too it, and git will be my source of truth. Ignore that I can `git push --force` and rewrite history.
