I'm a closeted fan of the Denver Nuggets. Nikola Jokic is my favorite player, ever, and I will confidently argue that he's currently in the greatest offensive peak ever. I love Denver and Colorado broadly, it's pretty much my ideal place to live.

I hate the Lakers. I'm a Celtics fan, hating the Lakers is in my blood. People who act like sports is supposed to be some egalitarian kumbaya is a fucking liar. The only thing that brings me more pleasure than my team winning is seeing my enemies suffer.

So, thank you Jamal Murray, for playing horrible for most of the game, letting the Lakers get a 20 point lead on you, then going 6/8 in the fourth quarter and hitting an incredible game winner on AD, who spent the prior morning whining about not being defensive player of the year.

The Nuggets have now beat the Lakers 10 times in a row. They're likely going to get swept again.

I love basketball.
