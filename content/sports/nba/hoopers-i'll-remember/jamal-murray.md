Is Jamal Murray the greatest 0x All-Star in league history? I would say so. The man has rightfully earned the nickname of a "big games merchant". I have NEVER seen a man rise like this in the playoffs. I don't know if playoff risers are truly a real phenomenon, or some players just don't even bother to try in the regular season. Jamal Murray might be the exception.

 In January of 2024, the Nuggets came to Boston where I witnessed Jamal hitting turnaround 20 foot jumpers with Jrue Holiday and Derrick White, the best guard defenders in the league. Like what?

I witnessed this man [[jamal-murray-game-winner-2024|hit a game winner on the Lakers]] after going 3-15, and then he proceeded to hit another game winner on the Lakers 3 games later.

Nikola Jokic is arguably one of the top 3 greatest offensive players of all-time and his excellence carries into the playoffs, but Jamal completes this team. The Nuggets went nowhere without his ridiculously tough shotmaking in the seasons following his ACL tear. The Jokic-Murray PnR is the stuff of nightmares.

If the Nuggets win it all this year (and defeat my beloved Celtics, got forbid), he's gonna be in the Hall. His personal career accolades will read:

> NBA All-Rookie Second Team (2017)

I guarantee you kids will wonder why the Oldheads speak about him elusively, citing the lack of accolades. But we will never forget you, Jamal Murray.
