This is an ode to Michael Porter Jr, aka MPJ. He was selected with the 14th overall pick in the 2018 NBA Draft, but he honestly may have gone first overall if it weren't for that pesky back of his. 

As a sidenote, I want to salute modern science, it's incredible how we've managed to make things that would literally kill people a hundred years ago into living a fruitful life.

There's literally nothing going on in his head. I understand this is probably mean of me to say but it's literally like a DVD logo bouncing around. But he hoops.
