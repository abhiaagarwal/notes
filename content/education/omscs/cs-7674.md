My second class at OMSCS was cs-7674, Machine Learning for Trading (**ML4T**). I thought it was... alright? It's mostly just Python stuff, of which I'm very familiar with. I took it alongside [[cs-6200|gios]]. It's kind of like an introduction into data science techniques with a focus on ML. Now I'm not an ML person at all, my undergraduate background is in Economics and Math, but ML is just statistical models.

I spent maybe 10 hours per week on the class.
