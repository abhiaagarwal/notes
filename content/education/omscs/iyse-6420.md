I took IYSE-6420, Bayesian Statistics in Fall of 2024.

I liked it! I don't really have much to say about it. Having a degree in economics, I've always held appreciation of Bayesian methods, and it was nice to see it used in an actual programming language and _not_ Stata.

Breezy, fun, and insanely informative — being able to model problems by simply describing what you have, and letting it sample a probability space — is awesome, and I foresee it being able to be applied to my career.
