title: Why I want to write
---

I've been skilled my whole life with "technical" things. My whole life, I've breezed through classes in math, physics, economics, etc. I sleepwalked my way through nearly 15 years of schooling and achieved nearly everything I've wanted.

So imagine my shock, when for the first time in my life, I discovered terrible at philosophy. So terrible, that I really understood what it was like to be "the guy who doesn't want to be called on in class" because I knew I was about to say some stupid shit. And my professors were nice to me, but I could always tell that "damn, this dumbass just said some stupid shit".

Thinking is cool, I guess. But communication is the thing that drives us. We're a social species! The people who are great are the people who know how to speak. They're the people who know how to write. No one should seriously care about the "thinkers" â€” it's easy to think grandiose things when you never have to have them challenged.

This is a privileged position to take. I'm sure people who are better writers than me and less technically skilled than I am probably want my technical skills as well. I think that's human nature. Oh well.

So, I hope that by writing more, I'll become a better writer. This is a hard task for me. I've never forced myself to get better at something, because why focus on what I'm bad at when I can be good at what I'm good at? You should realize that's a pretty dumb way to live life, it fortunately only took me 23.3 years to realize that.

I also think I'm probably gonna get Alzheimer's. Okay, probably not, but I refuse to live my life collecting so many trinkets of random information inside my brain only for it to be stolen from me by forces greater than me. I guess my legacy will live as long as Github lives.
