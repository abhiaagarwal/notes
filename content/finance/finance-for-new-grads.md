# Introduction

I want to preface this by saying

**YOU ARE NOT A DUMMY!!!!!**

Finance is not something that's taught in schools.^[1] Money doesn't matter until it does matter. I certainly blindly earned paychecks from odd jobs until I got my first big-boy job after college, until everything hit me.

_What the heck is a ROTH IRA?_
_Girl, what the hell is a Traditional IRA_
_401k?? Employee match. Pre-tax deduction???_
_Why should I care about Retirement? I'm 22 years old?_
_Federal Taxes? State Taxes? WTF is a 'FICA'???_
_Will the government jail me if I underpay my taxes?_

You are not alone if you have these questions. There are few trustworthy sources for financial information, with most companies trying to sell some product. You really shouldn't trust me either â€” instead, I'll do my best to link the sources that further elaborate on my thinking.

I wrote this primarily because I became "the guy" explaining finance to all my friends, and quite frankly, I got tired of copy-pasting the spiel I wrote in my notes app. As such, this is written from the perspective of someone making the median income after graduating college in the United States, which I've guesstimated to be around 50k, give or take. If you're not a college graduate, or you're making more or less, don't sweat; your income is not a reflection of your self-worth, and this advice can be generalized to anyone. Even if you've been working for a long time, you might learn something new from this.

Let's dive in!

> If you're interested in reading a book, I'd recommend checking out _A Simple Path to Wealth_ by JL Collins. While I personally haven't read it, I've had plenty of friends who have and strongly recommend it. I'd recommend it over this document. At the very least, consider checking it out from your local library after you've read this.

# Give me the rundown!

Okay, so you have a big boy job now. You've just earned your first paycheck. Let's break down what your paycheck actually _is_.

Here's an example paycheck for someone making a 50k salary, just base, no bonus/equity/whatever. This is modeled after my own paycheck in Massachusetts.

| Line Item            | Amount | Explanation                                       |
| -------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Gross Income         | +1923  | Your salary divided by the amount of pay periods  |
| Federal Income Taxes | -148   | Progressive, depends on your income               |
| State Income Taxes   | -80    | Often a flat tax                                  |
| Local Income taxes   | 0      | Depends really                                    |
| Social Security      | -114   | Pays into Social Security                         |
| Medicare             | -27    | Pays for Medicare                                 |
| Healthcare           | -85    | Healthcare you chose, deducted from your paycheck |
| => Net Income        | 1470   | _your_ money                                      |

Your **gross** income is the money you make _before_ taxes and various deductions, while your **net** income is the money you you get afterwards. Net goes into your bank account.

# Let's go deep.

## Banking

## Taxes

## Healthcare

## Retirement

## Investing, in general

## Credit Cards
