Credit cards are such a fun system. For me, there's kinda a thrill associated with them â€” you get access to "free" money for a month, but if you fuck up, you get hit with an exorbitant fine.

Credit cards are a big driver of inequality. The current system is based on rewards being funded through irresponsible borrowers. It's basically a wealth transfer from the poor to the wealthy. On a logical level, I shouldn't really support it. If credit cards rewards were to disappear tomorrow, I wouldn't mourn it.
