I grew up watching anime, but in recent years, I really fell out of love with the genre. It probably came with age, and my realization that most anime is kinda gross? It pushes some weird ideas. I don't like seeing non-consenting women being sexualized for "jokes". 

I decided to watch Frieren: Beyond Journey's End on a whim a few weeks ago. The show is about an elf who has lived at least a thousand years, and could probably live forever. On a whim, she decides to go join the Hero's party for 10 years to defeat the demon king, succeeds, then returns frolicking around. She meets up with her party 50 years later and witnesses the death of the hero, lamenting that she didn't get enough time to know him. And why should she? 10 years to us is give or take 15% of our lives â€” 10 years is 1% of her life. 

She decides to try and learn more about him, even after his death. She wants to learn more about the humans around her.

I think a lot about mortality. I should probably be thinking more about being at the club. But why wouldn't I? We only get one shot at a life. I wish I could believe in an afterlife, I really could, but I don't. 

I think the worst problem about being a human is how short our lifespans are. In the context of the universe as a whole. Our closest star outside the sun, Proxima Centauri, is 4.24 light years away. If we were to travel at the speed of life (which is impossible, but work with me), it would take 4.24 years to reach our next nearest star. That's greater than 5% of a human's life.

Okay, I'll stop thinking about mortality. For now.
